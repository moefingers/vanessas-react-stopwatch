# REACT-STOPWATCH
Cute stopwatch created using React!  
Simply press play and watch the seconds tick by~ :p  

### Includes a Timer!
Using the input boxes, select how long in the form of minutes/seconds you want the timer to countdown and press play!

## **Featured Changes**
- Sound now plays when timer reaches zero.
- A message now displays when timer reaches zero.
- Removed the pause button for the timer.

## Future Goals
- A theme selector that changes the overall color scheme of the app.
- Up and down arrows for the timer that changes the minutes and seconds, instead of input fields.

<sub>*The stopwatch and some styling in this project were inspired by Bro Code's React Stopwatch tutorial on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPo0mIcNZfM*</sub>
